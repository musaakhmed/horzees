                    <p>
                        We are all over the world, yet very close to each other.
                        Privetly doxxed and willing to be out there working
                        tight knit with the community. Let's get to know each
                        other.

                    <h2>Llisa</h2>
                    <p>
                        A true entrepreneur with a brain that never rests. He
                        came up with the idea, the name and the designs, and put
                        it out there for the rest of the team to develop. And we
                        did.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Amy Pond</h2>
                    <p>
                        From Tokenomics to the UI of the website you are
                        scrolling through right now, it sometimens feels like
                        there is nothing she cannot do. Works hard, parties
                        harder.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Arrogant</h2>
                    <p>
                        A ream manager. Puches people, gets things done, keeps
                        everyone together. At all times. Wee bit of a control
                        freak. Not a texter.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Callmedogperson</h2>
                    <p>
                        If she was born as an Italian guy in the 15th century,
                        we would have been buying tickets to Louvre to see the
                        Horzees. Also, a dog person with a cat, can anything
                        ever top that?
                    </p>

                    <h2>Incantator</h2>
                    <p>
                        The dev that loves poems and film photography. A
                        sensitive soul with a big brain. True friend and an even
                        better teammate.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lapartas</h2>
                    <p>Tasteful dev who is in love with Amy Pond</p>

                    <h2>Mbee</h2>
